# Mondrian - Swift App prototyping in Xcode Playgrounds!

- Quick and flexibly prototype iOS screens using Swift 2.x and Xcode Playgrounds with minimal code.
- Codebase is subject to major architectural changes as Swift is still pretty new.
- PRs and suggestions are welcome!

# Usage:

```
import UIKit
import XCPlayground

let device = Device.iPhone6
let screen = Screen(device: device, type: .list, theme: .dark)
XCPlayground.XCPlaygroundPage.currentPage.liveView = screen.view
```
